work out the nitty gritty of casters, they calculate spell slots one way but have a different method for fixed spells known

randomization:
since I've settled on "same seed and parameters yields the same character, consistent across HD",
I can go back and redo the way it handles spellcaster abilities, asi progression, and other randomized choices to make
things a bit cleaner and more comprehensible

special weapons need exceptions:
lance, net

maybe rework 'weapons' as 'attacks'
it would be nice and convenient for users if things like eldritch blast were listed under attacks
it would also make CR calculations more reliable in cases like that

CR calc should allow for various modifiers, things like effective hp and damage output
sneak attack, for example, should increase effective damage
easiest method would probably be for characters to keep track of various cr mods and handle them individually
in the cr calculation
