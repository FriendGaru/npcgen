special weapons:
lance, net

The following traits need randomized spells:
extra_cantrip
natural_illusionist
Ideally, should consolidate all of the various innate magic traits into one unified system, perhaps have it coordinate
with the spellcasting system to prevent overlap

nice_list isn't getting the Oxford comma right

the cr calc should account for damage resistances
cr calc should also deal with 'minor' abilities somehow

spellcasting needs more cleanup
rekajigger the spell reserve choice selection method to use the much simpler shuffle each spell list and pop them
method. if each shuffle is seeded properly it will make character rebuilds that change spelllists more consistent.
also, rename spell things to be clearer

give NPCGenerator get_ methods so other places don't have to directly access its weapons/armors/spellcaster_profiles dicts

right now, the class/race options are both too numerous and inflexible
it would be nice, for example, if instead of having a separate entry for every cleric class, we had one 'cleric' entry
and when the user selects that option, more selection options pop up for each domain
or, perhaps instead of having a bazillion dragonborn entries, there's just one and when the user selects it they
can either leave it random or select a specific option.
a class template, for example, should work in a way to override a class feature parameter with a user supplied one
and ALSO have a good way of keeping track of options to display.


THE BIG THING:
Gotta work on separating out the modules.
Content should handle all the stuff generated from
