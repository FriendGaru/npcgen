work out the nitty gritty of casters, they calculate spell slots one way but have a different method for fixed spells known

randomization:
since I've settled on "same seed and parameters yields the same character, consistent across HD",
I can go back and redo the way it handles spellcaster abilities, asi progression, and other randomized choices to make
things a bit cleaner and more comprehensible
