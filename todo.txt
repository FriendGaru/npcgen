THE BIG THING:
rework as much as possible to take owners upon instantiation
Like, CharacterFeatures always need to belong to a character, so I should just specify the owner upon intantiation
instead of passing around character references all the time
Could make the code MUCH more readable

special weapons need exceptions:
lance, net

The following traits need randomized spells:
extra_cantrip
natural_illusionist
Ideally, should consolidate all of the various innate magic traits into one unified system, perhaps have it coordinate
with the spellcasting system to prevent overlap
